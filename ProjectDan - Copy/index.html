            hires CLI to visit the construction site and assess progress. We are looking to show
            where the project is in relation to the timeline that was set out, checking the accuracy
            compared to the original draw request, and reviewing the budget. We also are directed to
            look at any stored materials kept on the site.

            >A construction lending best practice used by most lenders is ordering draw inspections
            to validate progress in conjunction with disbursing funds. The simplest reason for draw
            inspections is to follow along with the builder so that both the project owner and the
            lender can ensure the loan proceeds are going into the collateral on the loan, and to
            identify progress concerns as early as possible.</p

          <p
            ><span class="first-character ny">A</span>draw inspection is important for a number of
            reasons, but essentially it ensures that all money on a construction loan is accounted
            for. It lets the lender know where the project is compared to the timeline they were
            given. Most risk mitigation companies insist on funds being given out based on the
            results of these draw inspections because they want to ensure that thereâ€™s no more money
            tied up than is necessary for the project. Draw inspections can also help track funds
            because the inspector has to account for every cost request and compare it to the
            on-site representation.

            >Inspections are also important to the builder in that they ensure they are receiving
            payment for work completed so that they have the funds to continue on to the next phase
            of construction. Above all else, inspections are important for the project owner, to aid
            in the smooth and timely completion of the project.
